# how to play:
In my first project, I decided to recreate a memory card game using html, css, and javascript.
This is a memory matching card game. The goal is to match each card's icon with its pair. There are 16 cards and 18 pairs total. Click Start Game, and you will have a couple of seconds to memorize the position of the cards. When the cards all flip over, you can start flipping them to pairs. If the cards are matched, you will be alerted that you've found a match. If not, the cards will flip back over and you can find another pair.
